## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on the [Intelligent Archive](https://alpineintelligence.ch/unlock-hidden-knowledge/) which is already used by several companies to talk to their documents, create proposals, speed up onboarding time and much more. 

Additionally, I can help you identify generative AI use cases, create (small and large scale) Software Architectures, create prototypes and enterprise grade implementations for you (fullstack)
 (Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Angular, SQL and NO-SQL Databases, lots of frameworks and patterns, Azure and Google Cloud, Solution Architecture,... )

Find me at [Alpine Intelligence](https://alpineintelligence.com) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/boris-schickedanz).
